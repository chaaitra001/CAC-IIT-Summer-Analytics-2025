# Capstone Project: Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

This project implements a dynamic pricing model for urban parking lots, using simulation and data analysis to optimize pricing strategies. It includes simulations with [Pathway](https://pathway.com/), data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy, and visualizations built using Bokeh. 
Developed in Google Colab for ease of collaboration and reproducibility.

## 📈 Project Architecture

Below is a high-level overview of how the components interact:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load and preprocess historical parking demand data (synthetic or real).
   - Feature engineering for time of day, day of week, etc.

2. **Simulation Pipeline (Pathway)**
   - Simulate demand under different pricing strategies.
   - Model feedback loop between price changes and occupancy levels.

3. **Pricing Algorithm**
   - Dynamic pricing logic (e.g. demand-based adjustments, time-of-day pricing).
   - Integration with simulation to evaluate strategy performance.

4. **Visualisation (Bokeh)**
   - Interactive plots for occupancy vs price.
   - Time series of revenue and utilization rates.

5. **Analysis & Insights**
   - Summarise key findings.
   - Recommend pricing strategies based on simulation results.
